# Non-Linear-FEM
Non-linear finite element analysis on a pipe section 


### Problem Statement 
The problem of creep of a thick-walled pipe under internal pressure p is considered
as sketched . The pressure rises linearly up to its final value pmax and
is then hold until final time. Plain strain along z direction is 0 conditions are
assumed.


#### Material Routine 
The material is consider to be visco-elastic and thus non-linearity is implemented by using Newton Raphson method.
